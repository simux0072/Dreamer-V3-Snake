# Snake Game
A silly little snake game that looks smooth and not too fast or choppy.
Everything was coded from scratch, so it's not the fastest or cleanest looking code.
Libraries used: pygames (for rendering and drawing to the screen, since I'm too lasy to make my own)
Plans to make it better: I'm thinking of making a modified version that would be used to train AI.
